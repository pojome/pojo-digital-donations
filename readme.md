### Welcome to our GitHub Repository

Selling digital downloads is something that not a single one of the large WordPress ecommerce plugins has ever gotten really right. This plugin aims to fix that. Instead of focusing on providing every single feature under the sun, Pojo Digital Donations tries to provide only the ones that you really need. It aims to make selling digital downloads through WordPress easy, and complete.
